## Initial Thoughts
  This was a game that I discovered on accident when browsing steam out of boredom. When I first glanced at it, I was almost put off because I thought it was going to be a generic racing game with bikes. I WAS WRONG. Descenders is quite the opposite of your standard car or bike game. There is no racing, instead you find yourself racing downhill at incredible speeds while managing not to bust your ass on curves or the stunts they throw your way. Each time you spin up a new game, your path is procedurally generated, so you don't exactly know what to expect, nor can you study a map to master what they throw at you.

  I found myself doing stunts over oncoming trains, abandoned ruins, and dodging bails of hay. The ultimate objective is to make it through each series of challenges the game throws your way to progress to other maps, but be careful as you only have a limited amount of lives and your reputation depends on you doing well! Each stage offers a bonus mission that will allow you to gain another life if you choose to complete it, and they only get harder the farther you progress.

  My only complaints are the lack of different tricks you can pull off when hitting stunts. While the controls are fluid and responsive, I find myself burnt out doing flips and spins repeatedly to gain more reputation.

  All in all, I'm having a blast breaking my neck virtually over rocks and tasting tree bark at 70mph. For an early access game, RageSquid has managed to capture the true essence of what fun should be.
